\begin{abstract}
This paper proposes an improvement to lifelong learning for cross-domain sentiment classification.
Lifelong learning is to retain knowledge from past learning tasks to improve the learning task on a new domain.
In this paper, we will discuss how bigram and bag-of-bigram features integrated into a lifelong learning system can help improve the performance of sentiment classification on both Vietnamese and English.
Also, pre-processing techniques specifically for our cross-domain, Vietnamese dataset will be discussed.
Experimental results show that our method achieves improvements over prior systems and its potential for cross-domain sentiment classification.
%Statistical machine learning techniques have achieved promising results for sentiment classification.
%In the Internet age, it is essential to transfer the knowledge from the domain we learned to adapt an unfamiliar domain and still have a high accuracy of predicting if a user review is positive or negative.
%lifelong learning had proved its performance in topic modeling and sentiment classification in English.
%However, for low-resource language such as Vietnamese, there are many problems to deal with to get the similar performance.
%This paper presents an empirical study on Vietnamese sentiment classification.
%Our proposed method is based on lifelong learning but combined with black-list and segmentation techniques specifically for Vietnamese.
%The results are promising, showing that the method is able to make relatively accurate predictions even when no labeled data is given.
