\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we have presented our method that uses lifelong learning for cross-domain sentiment classification on English and Vietnamese. 
Experimental results on both corpus showed that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Lifelong learning approach is effective for cross-domain sentiment classification in Vietnamese as well as in English.
	\item Incorporating bigram and bag-of-bigram features into lifelong learning improved the performance of the system.
	\item Emoticons and word segmentation made a slight improvement in sentiment classification on the Vietnamese dataset.
\end{itemize}

There is abundant room for further progress of our work.
We would like to further exploit the sentiments from emoticons due to the high rate of occurrences of these in our dataset. 
Besides, future work could be focused on another collection of reviews with different qualities and different types of products to verify our proposed method.
